### About me
I am an aspiring Web Developer hoping to make an exciting career change the world of tech. My background is mainly in Science and Education, but have always had a knack for problem solving and since taking up coding I've realised this is the direction I want to pursue.<br>
I am currently studying in a Web Development Bootcamp with Hyperion Development where I am learning the fundamentals of JavaScript, HTML, CSS and React. While the tasks and projects so far have been challenging I find it so rewarding when something clicks and comes together. I have added a couple of Capstone Projects to my GitHub to showcase everything I have learnt so far.<br><br><br>
