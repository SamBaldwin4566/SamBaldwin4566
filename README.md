### About me
I am an aspiring Software Developer, currently kickstarting my career through an apprenticeship. With a background in Science, Iâ€™ve always had a knack for problem-solving, and discovering coding has solidified my passion for pursuing a career in technology.</br>

In 2023, I began my coding journey by completing a Web Development Bootcamp with Hyperion Development, where I gained a strong foundation in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. While the projects were challenging, the satisfaction of seeing them come together was incredibly rewarding. To showcase my progress, Iâ€™ve included my capstone projects from the bootcamp, reflecting my development journey from the start.</br>

Since then, Iâ€™ve explored various areas of the tech industry and worked on personal projects to deepen my skills. I briefly volunteered as a Frontend Developer with Farmspeak Technology to refine my expertise before securing my first role as an Apprentice Software Developer with FenTrack Ltd.</br>
