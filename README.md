### About me
I am an aspiring Web Developer hoping to make an exciting career change the world of tech. My background is mainly in Science and Education, but have always had a knack for problem solving and since taking up coding I've realised this is the direction I want to pursue.<br>
I have recently completed a Web Development Bootcamp with Hyperion Development where I have learned the fundamentals of JavaScript, HTML, CSS and React. While the tasks and projects were challenging I found it so rewarding when something clicks and comes together. I have decided to add my capstone projects from my bootcamp to show my coding journey from the very beginning to where I am now.<br><br><br>
